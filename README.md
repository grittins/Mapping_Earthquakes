# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Resources

- Mapbox API

- Software: Visual Studio Code (javascript, css, html)

## Overview

Using the help of Mapbox API, earthquake data is showcased in 3 different map views: 
- Streets
- Satellite 
- Dark

The tectonic plate's location can also be seen using the filters added. Additionally, a filter for all the major earthquakes (greater than 4.5) is also added. 

All the data is from the past 7 days.
